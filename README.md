# Ranodm Color Game

## How do I play?
There will be a random position led on both the left and right half of the board. Pushing the left button advances the left “selector led” one space. Pushing the right buttons advances the right “selector led” one position. The objective of the game is to get your selector leds on the left and right sides over the randomized colored leds. Each round the timer gets faster and faster. If you accidentally pass the lit-up led with your selector led, you lose. If you don’t get your selector led onto the random led in the allotted time you also lose. You know you lose when the lights turn red, your score will be read alloud to you.
